# HOW TO FIX BLOCKED IMEI ON PIXEL 5
---

Yesterday i bought a second phone from local marketplace, after few days the phone brick and got signal lost. I try using another sim card but it still does't work. I try to give it back to the seller, but it takes one week till they give the phone back to me. So I decided to fix it by my self.

## Important Things
**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!**

### before we go more further... IMEI is a unique identification number programmed onto your phone. It is required in order to be correctly identified on a mobile network. Without one, you cannot make calls, send SMS or use mobile data. I live in Indonesia, and every smartphone that enters Indonesia must register its IMEI at the ministry. they call it KEMENPERIN dan BEA CUKAI.

# HOW TO FIX BLOCKED IMEI ON PIXEL 5
---

Yesterday i bought a second phone from local marketplace, after few days the phone brick and got signal lost. I try using another sim card but it still does't work. I try to give it back to the seller, but it takes one week till they give the phone back to me. So I decided to fix it by my self.
